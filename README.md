# BatchPrank
Have a friend who uses Windows and want to prank him/her? Well the installer.bat file that's in this repo is exactly what you need!
Just open it up using something like Notepad, change the 'Minecraft' (with quotes) to something like 'Halo' or 'Pokemon'. Then send it off to your friend!
